# Portfolio

  

  ## Description
  As a developer I need a site to showcase my projects, allow people to contact me, and tell a little bit about myself. I have created a Portfolio site to accomplish this.

  ## Usage
  The site starts a user at the About Me page, and across the top has a navigation bar which will take them to my Portfolio, a Contact Page, and a CV page. The Portfolio page allows a user to access either a site or walkthrough video of my past projects. The Contact page allows a user to send me a message, and the CV page lists both my development skills and allows a download of my most recent CV.
